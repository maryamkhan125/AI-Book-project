# Constitution: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## 1. Mission
This book aims to teach Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics as a foundational skill
for the future of work, where humans, AI agents, and robots collaborate.

The textbook is AI-native, spec-driven, and designed for scalable learning
without runtime AI dependencies.

## 2. Target Audience
- Undergraduate CS / AI / Robotics students
- Self-learners entering Physical AI
- Engineers transitioning from software AI to robotics
- Educators at Panaversity, PIAIC, GIAIC

---

## 3. Pedagogical Principles
- Learn by building mental models before hardware
- Concept → Simulation → System thinking
- Simple language, progressive complexity
- No assumed robotics background

---

## 4. AI-Native Principles (No Runtime APIs)
- AI Agents are taught conceptually
- Prompt-based thinking is embedded as exercises
- Decision-making flows are explained without live API calls
- All content must be statically deployable

---

## 5. Spec-Driven Development Rules
- Every module must map to a spec
- Every spec must map to tasks
- Tasks must be independently verifiable
- Content should be modular and reusable

---

## 6. Technology Constraints
- Docusaurus for documentation
- Markdown / MDX only
- GitHub Pages deployment
- No API keys or secrets required

---

## 7. Accessibility & Clarity
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- Clear diagrams (textual / conceptual)
- Glossary for new terms
- Ethical considerations included

---

## 8. Definition of Done
A module is considered complete when:
- Learning objectives are met
- Examples are provided
- Exercises are included
- No runtime dependencies exist
